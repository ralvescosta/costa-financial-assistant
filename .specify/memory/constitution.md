# Costa Financial Assistant Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Modular Monorepo Architecture (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

The entire project MUST live in a single monorepo.
Frontend and backend are top-level modules with no shared source coupling.
Backend services (BFF API, files-grpc, bills-grpc, scheduler-grpc, and future services)
MUST be independently deployable units with no cross-service direct imports.
Circular dependencies between modules are forbidden.
Each microservice owns its own domain; shared utilities MUST live in `pkgs/` and MUST NOT
encode domain logic.

### II. SOLID Principles & Clean Architecture (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Every backend service MUST follow SOLID principles at all layers.
The canonical Go project layout for each service is:

```
cmd/
  container.go      # dependency injection wiring via uber/dig
  <service>_cmd.go  # cobra CLI command entrypoint
internals/
  <domain>/
    services/       # business logic — depends only on interfaces
    interfaces/     # Go interfaces (*.go) — no implementations here
    *.go            # domain types, errors
    *_test.go       # unit tests alongside source
  repositories/     # data access implementations
    unit_of_work.go # Unit of Work: transaction boundary coordinator
    *.go
    *_test.go
  transport/
    grpc/           # gRPC handlers
    rmq/            # RabbitMQ consumers/producers (.gitkeep if unused)
migrations/         # SQL migration files managed by golang-migrate
  <NNN>_<description>.up.sql
  <NNN>_<description>.down.sql
pkgs/               # shared, domain-agnostic utilities
mocks/              # auto-generated mocks (uber/mock)
```

Services MUST depend on interfaces, never on concrete implementations.
The `internals/` tree MUST NOT import from `cmd/`.
Dependency injection MUST use `uber/dig`; manual wiring in `cmd/container.go` is forbidden
beyond registration calls.
CLI entrypoints MUST use `cobra`.

Every domain concept that exposes behaviour MUST be modelled as a Go interface defined in
`internals/<domain>/interfaces/` paired with a concrete struct that implements it in
`internals/<domain>/`. All methods that belong to a type MUST be receiver methods on that
struct — standalone (orphan) functions are forbidden inside `internals/`. Only `pkgs/`
may contain package-level helper functions, because those are shared, domain-agnostic
utilities with no natural owning struct.

### III. Cloud Native & Containerization (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Every service and the frontend MUST be containerized via Docker.
Backend container images MUST support multi-platform builds targeting at minimum
`linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` (use `docker buildx` with `--platform` flag).
All services MUST follow the 12-factor app methodology:
configuration via environment variables, stateless processes, explicit dependency
declaration, disposability.
A `docker-compose.yml` MUST exist at the repository root providing all local-dev
dependencies: PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, a file-storage service (e.g., MinIO), and the
`grafana/otel-lgtm` image which bundles the full Grafana observability stack
(Loki, Grafana, Tempo, Mimir/Prometheus) for local telemetry validation.
Backend services MUST expose health-check endpoints consumable by container orchestrators.

### IV. Frontend Component-First, Hook Isolation & Design System (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

The frontend MUST use React at the current LTS version.
Every screen MUST be a pure composition of reusable components; no business logic is
permitted inside a screen presentation file.
Before creating a new component, an existing component MUST be evaluated for reuse or
extension.
Business logic, state management, and data-fetching MUST be encapsulated in custom hooks
(`use*.ts` files); the corresponding screen file contains only JSX/TSX and style bindings.
Each feature MUST ship at minimum two artifacts: a presentation file (screen) and one or
more custom hook files. Co-locating them in the same file is forbidden.

**Design Token System & Color Palette**:
The frontend MUST maintain a single, centralised design token file
(e.g., `src/styles/tokens.ts` or `src/theme/tokens.ts`) that is the authoritative
source for every color, spacing, typography scale, border radius, shadow, and z-index
value used anywhere in the application. No color or visual constant may be hardcoded
outside this file.

The color palette MUST be defined following best-practice token layering:
1. **Primitive tokens** — raw named values that define the complete palette
   (e.g., `blue500: '#3B82F6'`, `neutral900: '#111827'`). These MUST NOT be referenced
   directly in components.
2. **Semantic tokens** — purpose-driven aliases that map to primitives and carry meaning
   (e.g., `colorPrimary`, `colorSurface`, `colorTextPrimary`, `colorBorder`,
   `colorDanger`, `colorSuccess`). Components MUST reference only semantic tokens.
3. **Component tokens** — optional, component-scoped tokens that map to semantic tokens
   (e.g., `buttonPrimaryBackground`) for components that need fine-grained control.

The palette MUST include at minimum the following semantic token categories:
- Background surfaces (`colorBackground`, `colorSurface`, `colorSurfaceElevated`)
- Text (`colorTextPrimary`, `colorTextSecondary`, `colorTextDisabled`,
  `colorTextInverse`)
- Brand / interactive (`colorPrimary`, `colorPrimaryHover`, `colorPrimaryActive`)
- Status (`colorSuccess`, `colorWarning`, `colorDanger`, `colorInfo`)
- Border & divider (`colorBorder`, `colorBorderFocus`, `colorDivider`)
- Overlay / shadow (`colorOverlay`)

**Dark mode and light mode are both MANDATORY**.
The theme system MUST expose a `light` and a `dark` variant; each variant MUST define
values for every semantic token. No semantic token may be left undefined in either theme.
The active theme MUST be toggled by the user and the preference MUST be persisted
(e.g., in `localStorage`). The system MUST also respect the OS-level
`prefers-color-scheme` preference on first load when no stored preference exists.
Theme switching MUST NOT require a page reload.

The token file and theme definitions MUST be version-controlled alongside source;
design changes that alter semantic token names are breaking changes and require a
constitution patch at minimum.

**Typography Scale**:
The centralised design token file MUST define a complete typography scale.
No font size, font weight, or line-height value may be hardcoded in a component or
style file outside the token file.

The scale MUST follow a two-layer structure matching the color token approach:
1. **Primitive font-size tokens** — raw rem values
   (e.g., `fontSizeXs: '0.75rem'`, `fontSizeBase: '1rem'`). These MUST NOT be
   referenced directly in components.
2. **Semantic typography tokens** — role-named aliases mapped to primitives
   (e.g., `fontSizeBody`, `fontSizeHeading1`, `fontSizeCaption`). Components MUST
   reference only these semantic tokens.

The scale MUST include at minimum the following primitive tokens:

| Token | Value | px equiv | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| `fontSizeXs` | `0.75rem` | 12px | Captions, badges, fine print |
| `fontSizeSm` | `0.875rem` | 14px | Secondary labels, metadata |
| `fontSizeBase` | `1rem` | 16px | Body text (default) |
| `fontSizeLg` | `1.125rem` | 18px | Large body, card content |
| `fontSizeXl` | `1.25rem` | 20px | Section sub-headings |
| `fontSize2xl` | `1.5rem` | 24px | Page sub-headings |
| `fontSize3xl` | `1.875rem` | 30px | Page primary headings |
| `fontSize4xl` | `2.25rem` | 36px | Hero / display numbers |

And at minimum the following semantic tokens:

| Semantic token | → Primitive |
|---|---|
| `fontSizeCaption` | `fontSizeXs` |
| `fontSizeBodySmall` | `fontSizeSm` |
| `fontSizeBody` | `fontSizeBase` |
| `fontSizeLabel` | `fontSizeSm` |
| `fontSizeHeading4` | `fontSizeLg` |
| `fontSizeHeading3` | `fontSizeXl` |
| `fontSizeHeading2` | `fontSize2xl` |
| `fontSizeHeading1` | `fontSize3xl` |
| `fontSizeDisplay` | `fontSize4xl` |

Font weight tokens MUST also be defined:
`fontWeightRegular` (400), `fontWeightMedium` (500), `fontWeightSemibold` (600),
`fontWeightBold` (700).

Line-height tokens MUST also be defined:
`lineHeightTight` (1.25), `lineHeightSnug` (1.375), `lineHeightNormal` (1.5),
`lineHeightRelaxed` (1.625).

All font-size values in the token file MUST use `rem` units; `px` is forbidden for
font sizes to ensure accessibility and browser zoom compatibility.

**Mobile-First Responsive Layout**:
All frontend screens and components MUST be designed and implemented mobile-first:
base styles target the smallest viewport (320px minimum) and breakpoints are applied
using `min-width` media queries exclusively. `max-width` media queries for layout
breakpoints are forbidden.

The following breakpoints MUST be defined as tokens and used consistently:

| Token | Min-width | Target |
|---|---|---|
| `breakpointSm` | `480px` | Large phones |
| `breakpointMd` | `768px` | Tablets |
| `breakpointLg` | `1024px` | Laptops / small desktops |
| `breakpointXl` | `1280px` | Desktops |
| `breakpoint2xl` | `1536px` | Large / wide desktops |

Responsive rules:
- Every screen MUST be functional and usable at 320px viewport width without horizontal
  scrolling or content clipping.
- Touch targets (buttons, links, interactive elements) MUST be at minimum 44×44 CSS
  pixels to comply with WCAG 2.5.5 and platform HIG guidelines.
- Images and media MUST use relative sizing (e.g., `max-width: 100%`, `width: 100%`)
  and MUST NOT have fixed pixel dimensions that break at narrow viewports.
- Layouts MUST be tested at a minimum of these widths: 320px, 375px, 768px, 1024px,
  1280px before merge.
- Screen density: all icons and image assets MUST be provided in SVG or at 1×/2×/3×
  resolutions to support standard, Retina, and high-DPI displays.

### V. Test Discipline

Unit tests are MANDATORY for all service and repository implementations in the backend.
All unit tests MUST follow BDD (Behaviour-Driven Development) style and the
Triple-A structure — every test body MUST contain explicit Arrange, Act, and Assert
phases, separated by blank lines and optionally labeled with inline comments
(`// Arrange`, `// Act`, `// Assert`) to make intent unambiguous.
Test names MUST describe behaviour in the form `TestSubject_WhenCondition_ThenOutcome`
or an equivalent BDD-readable sentence.
Mocks MUST be auto-generated using `uber/mock` (`mockgen`) and placed in `mocks/`;
hand-written mocks are forbidden.
Integration tests MUST cover inter-service gRPC contracts and any RabbitMQ event contracts.
Frontend component tests are REQUIRED for all reusable components.
Tests MUST live alongside source (`*_test.go` for Go; `*.test.tsx` for React).
No production code may be merged that reduces existing test coverage without explicit
documented justification.

### VI. Observability & Structured Logging (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

All backend services MUST use `go.uber.org/zap` as the sole structured logger.
No other logging library (`slog`, `logrus`, `log`, etc.) is permitted in service code;
shared `pkgs/` utilities MUST accept a `*zap.Logger` parameter rather than hard-coding
a logger.
The zap logger MUST be configured with an OpenTelemetry log hook so that all log
emissions are forwarded to the OTel log pipeline
(use `go.opentelemetry.io/contrib/bridges/otelzap` or equivalent bridge).

Every backend service MUST instrument the full OpenTelemetry signal triad:
- **Logs**: via the zap→OTel bridge, exported to the OTLP endpoint.
- **Metrics**: via the OTel Metrics SDK (`go.opentelemetry.io/otel/metric`),
  exported to the OTLP endpoint; expose a Prometheus scrape endpoint as a secondary
  exporter where operationally justified.
- **Traces**: via the OTel Trace SDK (`go.opentelemetry.io/otel/trace`), exported
  to the OTLP endpoint; spans MUST be created at service method boundaries and
  at transport layer entry/exit points.

OTel SDK bootstrap (resource attributes, exporters, batch processors) MUST be
initialised in `cmd/container.go` via `dig` and shut down gracefully on process exit.

**Error logging rules** — whenever an error occurs, the log call MUST include:
- `zap.Error(err)` as the primary error field.
- At minimum one contextual field identifying the operation (e.g., `zap.String("op", ...)`).
- Any relevant entity IDs or input parameters that aid reproduction
  (e.g., `zap.String("user_id", ...)`, `zap.String("file_id", ...)`).
Logs MUST NOT be swallowed; every returned error MUST be logged at the point where it
cannot be propagated further upward.

**OTel context correlation** — every log call MUST attach the active OpenTelemetry
trace context so logs are correlated with traces. The `otelzap` bridge handles this
automatically when the logger is initialised with it; callers MUST pass the
`context.Context` carrying the active span to logger methods (`logger.Ctx(ctx).Error(...)`).
This ensures `trace_id` and `span_id` fields appear on every log record.

**Trace propagation**:
- gRPC: both server and client MUST use `go.opentelemetry.io/contrib/instrumentation/
  google.golang.org/grpc/otelgrpc` interceptors (unary + streaming).
- HTTP (BFF): MUST use `go.opentelemetry.io/contrib/instrumentation/net/http/otelhttp`
  middleware on every route so inbound W3C `traceparent` headers are extracted and
  outbound calls carry propagated context.
- RabbitMQ: trace context MUST be injected into and extracted from message headers using
  the W3C TraceContext propagation format.

Errors MUST be wrapped with contextual information at every layer boundary
(use `fmt.Errorf("...: %w", err)` or equivalent).

**Custom metrics — per-module health**:
Each independently-deployed service MUST define at minimum:
- An `up` gauge (`<service>_up`) set to `1` while the service is healthy, `0` otherwise.
- A `build_info` gauge carrying `version`, `go_version`, and `service` labels.
These metrics MUST be registered during OTel SDK bootstrap.

**Custom metrics — BFF endpoint tracking**:
The BFF MUST expose per-endpoint HTTP metrics following RED (Rate, Errors, Duration)
best practices:
- `bff_http_requests_total` counter — labels: `method`, `route`, `status_code`.
- `bff_http_request_duration_seconds` histogram — labels: `method`, `route`;
  buckets: `[.005, .01, .025, .05, .1, .25, .5, 1, 2.5, 5]`.
- `bff_http_errors_total` counter — labels: `method`, `route`, `status_code`;
  incremented only on 4xx/5xx responses.
These metrics MUST be populated by a centralised OTel HTTP middleware; duplicating metric
instrumentation per handler is forbidden.

### VII. Infrastructure-as-Code & Makefile Discipline

A `Makefile` MUST exist at the repository root with targets for each service:
`run/<service>`, `build/<service>`, `docker/build/<service>`, `test/<service>`,
and `lint/<service>`.
All infrastructure provisioning for local development MUST be reproducible via
`make dev-up` (wrapping `docker-compose up`) and `make dev-down`.
No manual steps outside documented `make` targets are acceptable for onboarding.

### VIII. Configuration & Secrets Management (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

All service configuration MUST be stored in `.env` files, one per environment
(e.g., `.env.dev`, `.env.staging`, `.env.prod`). No configuration value may be
hardcoded in source code.

`pkgs/configs` MUST implement a typed configuration loader that:
1. Reads the `APP_ENV` environment variable to select the target `.env` file.
2. Loads the file using `github.com/spf13/viper` into a well-typed Go struct
   that is shared across the service via dependency injection.
3. After loading, scans all string values for the sentinel pattern `${<KEY>}`.
   A value matching this pattern signals that the real secret lives in an external
   vault and MUST NOT appear in the `.env` file in plaintext.

`pkgs/secrets` MUST define a `SecretsProvider` interface:
```go
type SecretsProvider interface {
    GetSecret(ctx context.Context, key string) (string, error)
}
```
Two concrete implementations MUST exist:
- **HashiCorpVaultProvider** — using `github.com/hashicorp/vault/api`.
- **AWSSecretsManagerProvider** — using
  `github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/secretsmanager`.

The active provider is selected by the `SECRETS_PROVIDER` config value
(`vault` | `aws`); switching providers requires no code change.

At application startup, before any handler begins accepting traffic, the config
loader MUST iterate over all `${}` sentinel fields, call `SecretsProvider.GetSecret`
for each, and replace the sentinel with the resolved value in the config struct.
If any secret resolution fails, the application MUST abort startup with a fatal log.

Security constraints:
- `.env` files containing real secret values MUST NOT be committed to the repository.
- `.gitignore` MUST exclude all `.env.*` files except `.env.example`.
- `.env.example` MUST list every required key with a placeholder value, serving as
  the canonical documentation of the service's configuration surface.

### IX. Data Access & Database Discipline (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Cache-aside pattern**:
Every repository read operation that is eligible for caching MUST implement the
cache-aside pattern:
1. Check Redis for a cached result using a deterministic cache key.
2. On cache hit: deserialise and return the cached value.
3. On cache miss: query PostgreSQL, store the result in Redis with an appropriate TTL,
   then return the result.
Write operations (INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE) MUST invalidate or update affected cache
entries atomically with the database write where consistency requires it.
Cache keys MUST follow the convention `<service>:<entity>:<identifier>` to prevent
collisions across services.

**Index discipline**:
Before writing any repository query, the developer MUST:
1. Identify every column referenced in `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `JOIN ON`, or `GROUP BY`
   clauses of that query.
2. Verify that a suitable index exists in the migration history for those columns.
3. If no adequate index exists, a new migration file MUST be created to add it
   **before or alongside** the feature that introduces the query.
Index creation migrations MUST be idempotent (`CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS`).
Removing an index requires a corresponding `.down.sql` entry.

**Migration strategy**:
The sole migration runner is `github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/v4`.
Each backend service that owns a database schema MUST have a `migrations/` directory
at the service root (part of the canonical layout defined in Principle II) containing
sequentially numbered SQL files:
```
migrations/
  000001_create_<table>.up.sql
  000001_create_<table>.down.sql
  000002_add_<column_or_index>.up.sql
  000002_add_<column_or_index>.down.sql
```
Rules:
- Both DDL (schema changes: `CREATE TABLE`, `ALTER TABLE`, `CREATE INDEX`, etc.) and
  DML seed/reference data changes (`INSERT`, `UPDATE` on reference tables) MUST be
  tracked as versioned migration files — never applied manually.
- Every `.up.sql` MUST have a corresponding `.down.sql` that fully reverses the change.
- Migration files are immutable once merged; existing files MUST NOT be edited.
  Corrections require a new migration.
- Migrations MUST be applied automatically at service startup via the
  `golang-migrate` programmatic API, before the service begins accepting traffic.
- The `Makefile` MUST expose `migrate/up/<service>` and `migrate/down/<service>`
  targets for manual control during development.

**Idempotency**:
Every mutating resource endpoint or message handler — whether HTTP, gRPC, or RabbitMQ
consumer — MUST be idempotent: processing the same request or message more than once
MUST produce the same observable state as processing it exactly once.
Implementation rules:
- Each mutating operation MUST accept and persist a client-supplied or
  broker-assigned idempotency key (e.g., `X-Idempotency-Key` header for HTTP,
  a `idempotency_key` field in the Protobuf message, a `message_id` property for
  RabbitMQ AMQP messages).
- The idempotency key MUST be stored in a dedicated column or table alongside the
  resource; a unique database index MUST be created on this column to enforce
  deduplication at the persistence layer.
- On receipt of a duplicate key, the service MUST return the original response
  (or acknowledgement) without re-executing the operation.
- Idempotency key expiry policy (TTL or retention window) MUST be defined per resource
  and documented in the corresponding migration or spec.
- RabbitMQ consumers MUST check the idempotency key before processing and acknowledge
  duplicate messages without re-processing.

**Unit of Work / Atomicity**:
Whenever a business operation must modify more than one aggregate, table, or external
system (e.g., write to PostgreSQL + invalidate Redis + publish a RabbitMQ event), the
operation MUST be wrapped in a transaction boundary coordinated by the Unit of Work
pattern.
Each service MUST implement a `UnitOfWork` interface and its concrete implementation
in `internals/repositories/unit_of_work.go`:
```go
type UnitOfWork interface {
    Begin(ctx context.Context) (UnitOfWork, error)
    Commit(ctx context.Context) error
    Rollback(ctx context.Context) error
    // Repository accessors scoped to this transaction, e.g.:
    BillRepository() BillRepository
    FileRepository() FileRepository
}
```
Rules:
- The `UnitOfWork` struct MUST hold the active `*sql.Tx` (or equivalent) and expose
  transactional repository instances bound to that transaction.
- Service methods that require atomicity MUST accept a `UnitOfWork` factory via
  dependency injection (`uber/dig`) and call `Begin` → business logic → `Commit`;
  `Rollback` MUST be deferred immediately after `Begin`.
- Direct use of `*sql.DB` or `*sql.Tx` outside of repository implementations and
  `unit_of_work.go` is forbidden in `internals/`.
- Cache invalidation and outbox/event publishing that must be atomic with a database
  write MUST be coordinated inside the same Unit of Work scope using the
  transactional outbox pattern or equivalent.

## Development Workflow

Every feature branch MUST be reviewed against all nine core principles before merge.
A PR is blocked if:

1. A backend service violates the `cmd/internals/pkgs/mocks/migrations` directory contract.
2. A new concrete dependency is injected manually instead of via `dig`.
3. Frontend screen files contain business logic or inline state management outside hooks.
4. Mocks are hand-written rather than generated.
5. A new container image lacks multi-platform build support.
6. The `docker-compose.yml` is not updated when a new infrastructure dependency is added.
7. The `Makefile` is not updated when a new service is added.
8. An orphan (non-receiver) function appears inside `internals/`.
9. An error is returned without being logged at its final propagation boundary.
10. A log call omits `zap.Error(err)` or contextual fields when logging an error event.
11. A log call does not pass a `context.Context` carrying the active OTel span
    (breaking log-trace correlation).
12. A new gRPC service is introduced without `otelgrpc` interceptors on both sides.
13. A new HTTP route in the BFF is introduced without the OTel HTTP middleware.
14. A new independently-deployed service ships without `up` and `build_info` health metrics.
15. A configuration value is hardcoded instead of loaded from the `.env` / config struct.
16. A secret value appears in plaintext in any committed `.env` file
    (must use `${}` sentinel and be resolved via `pkgs/secrets` at startup).
17. A new repository read operation skips the cache-aside check for Redis before
    querying PostgreSQL (unless the entity is explicitly documented as non-cacheable).
18. A new query is introduced without a corresponding index review; if no suitable index
    exists, a migration adding one MUST be part of the same PR.
19. A schema or data change is applied without a versioned migration file in `migrations/`;
    direct DDL/DML executed outside the migration runner is forbidden.
20. An existing migration file is edited after being merged (corrections require a new
    migration file).
21. A service startup sequence does not run `golang-migrate` before accepting traffic.
22. A mutating HTTP/gRPC endpoint or RabbitMQ consumer is implemented without an
    idempotency key check and a unique index on the idempotency key column.
23. A business operation that modifies more than one aggregate or interacts with more
    than one persistence/messaging system does not use `UnitOfWork` from
    `internals/repositories/unit_of_work.go`.
24. A service method directly holds or passes a `*sql.Tx` outside of repository
    implementations and `unit_of_work.go`.
25. A frontend component or style file references a hardcoded color, spacing, or other
    visual constant instead of a semantic token from the centralised design token file.
26. A new semantic token is introduced without a corresponding value defined in both
    the `light` and `dark` theme variants.
27. A frontend component or style file uses a hardcoded font size, font weight, or
    line-height value instead of a semantic typography token from the token file.
28. A screen or component layout is not implemented mobile-first (base styles for
    320px minimum; breakpoints via `min-width` only; touch targets ≥ 44×44px).

Code review MUST verify that each gRPC service definition is accompanied by updated
`.proto` files committed to the repository (proto-first design).

All secrets MUST be injected via environment variables; no credentials may be committed
to the repository.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other architectural guidance documents.
Any amendment requires:
1. A documented rationale referencing the principle(s) being changed.
2. A version bump following semantic versioning (MAJOR for principle removal/redefinition,
   MINOR for new principle or material expansion, PATCH for clarifications or wording).
3. Update of this file and re-validation of dependent templates.

All PRs and reviews MUST verify compliance with this constitution.
Complexity violations MUST be documented in the plan's Complexity Tracking table with
justification.
Refer to `.specify/memory/constitution.md` as the authoritative governance reference
during feature planning and implementation.
